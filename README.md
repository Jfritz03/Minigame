Cannon Minigame
The cannon minigame has you controlling and aiming a cannon at blank white targets, the goal of the game is to shoot as many targets in a row without missing
Controls:
A & D move the cannon side to side
W & S aims the cannon up and down
Space shoots the cannon
P spawns a target

I have a few issue with the game as well as things i want to add
Issues:
The cannon rotates on the wrong axis (it rotates on the Y axis instead of the X axis)
The cannonballs delete the floor on contact
Pressing p spawns an exponential amount of targets
Future additions:
I want to make the targets spawn on a timer at diffrent distances away
